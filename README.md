# StatZone 📈

StatZone is an NBA Utility Stat bot meant to bring ease of access and statistics to Discord. Now you can look up a player's stats or strengths and weaknesses without leaving your application or server! StatZone is in its beta phases and is currently set up to work with the NBAC BBGM Server, which is set to the 2020 NBA season.

## Description 🏀

StatZone has a lot of capabilities and commands that you can use.
- ```ping```: Tells you if the bot is online and functional!
- ```playerStats```: Prints out all the stats a player has averaged through a season, including but not limited to PPG, APG, RPG, and PER.
- ```filterByStat```: Allows you to filter through the player_database based on a specific attribute and threshold. For example, if you are looking for elite passers, you can use this command to
find all players who have a Passing rating above 90.
- ```player_strengths_weaknesses```: Given a player, returns their strengths and their weaknesses. Especially useful to scout a draft class.
- ```allStars```: Returns the all-stars for the current year
